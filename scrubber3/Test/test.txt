<b> Mary</b> had a little <em>lamb</em>,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that <b> Mary</b> went,
the <em>lamb</em> was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see a <em>lamb</em> at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till <b> Mary</b> did appear.

"Why does the <em>lamb</em> love <b> Mary</b> so?"
the eager children cry.

"Why, <b> Mary</b> loves the <em>lamb</em>, you know."
 the teacher did reply.
