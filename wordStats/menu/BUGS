BUGS -- Anglo-Saxon Text Menu

- No Unselect in Firefox (menubvmjs.js)
	- UNRESOLVED as of 2010.06.29 
	- Okay, it is not a problem with the code, per se,
		but the setAttribute() function does not properly
		and fully change the attribute in all places, ie
		calling onclick() in the javascript will not use
		the new onclick() value.
