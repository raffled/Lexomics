README -- Virtual Manuscript v2
	/tools/virtualmanuscript/

OVERVIEW:
	Allows the user to choose texts and get word frequencies for
	their selection

FILES:
	index.php
		Builds the page. Includes necessary header and footer.
		The page operates in two modes, "intro" and "results".
		Intro mode is set when any or all of the URL GET variables are
		not present. In this mode, the directions to the user are 
		displayed. Results mode grabs the selected text and dipslays
		it. In both modes, the menu is necessarily displayed.

	directions.html
		Directions to use the tool. Is included by ./index.php when
		operating in intro mode.

	built_manu/
		Directory to temporarily store the user's folder with individual
		CSVs and overall CSV.

	built_manu_zips/
		Directory of zips created by users. No auto delete here.

	../modules/manuscript.php
		Module that contains all necessary functions to running both this
		tool and Word Frequencies. See the file for	more complete 
		documentation.

	../menu/
		Folder contains the files needed to build the dropdown menu 
		system and options menu. Documentation for it can be found there.
		Prior to including ../menu/menu.php, the variable $menujs must be
		set to "../menu/menubvmjs.js". This runs the menu to allow as many
		texts as the user wants selected.

	../data/
		The data directory. Flat files containing CSVs of text stats.

USE:
	When in results mode, each text name needs to parsed out
	of the URL and converted to a path to the appropriate CSV. 
	A directory is created for the user and the CSV is copied there.
	Each CSV is parsed into a hash table, and added to an overall hash.

	The array of hashes is merged into one and sorted and printed 
	to the page and then to a CSV file.

	The user's folder is zipped and deleted.

GET ARGS:
	file
		Multiple names of the texts concatenated with a space (this is seen 
		as a '+' in the URL but is a space really).
	sort
		[count|word] depending on the sort method chosen
	tags
		[keep|discard] tagged word
	consolidation
		[none|all|eth|and] choose what consolidations are desired
	top
		# of words user wants displayed
